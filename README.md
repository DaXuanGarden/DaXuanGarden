Hello, welcome to DaXuan's Growth Garden!🌱

💡Here you will find a record and review of DaXuan's journey through learning and scientific research.

🐣As a student of traditional Chinese medicine, I am well aware of the many areas I need to improve and develop on my path of learning and research exploration.

🔥Therefore, I greatly look forward to interacting and learning with teachers and classmates, striving to make greater progress together.

😀Feel free to send Daxuan an email at daxuan111000@163.com. Let's share our knowledge, exchange our experiences, and grow together.
